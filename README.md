## About The Project
YARA (Yet Another React App) is the 2022 version of my early-ish project templates for react. This time it's a yarn workspace based repo, mainly to be easely use as boilerplate to others projects and standardize everything without inserting code inside the project itself (●'◡'●)

## Getting Started
So... I can't really encourage anyone else to use it, but if you *reaaly* want, please give it a try ( •̀ ω •́ )y

### Prerequisites
The project was intended to run with `node 16`, but it _should_ be compatible with 14 ass well and uses `yarn` as package manager (for yarn workspaces)(npm >v6 also have an workspace manager, but I don't gave it a try yet)

I do recommend you to use `nvm` or any other node version manager in EVERYTHING node related

### Installation
1. If you don't have already, install yarn as global package
   ```sh
   npm install -g yarn
   ```
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/gkm2806/yara.git
   ```
1. Enter the project folder
   ```sh
    cd yara
    ```
1. Install packages
   ```sh
   yarn
   ```
1. Have fun 
   ```JS
   yarn workspace @yara/client dev
   ```
1. Rename everything and make it yours ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ

## Usage
Maybe someday, if I don't give up maintining this (as usual), I would like to create an script to set this as a template for npx/yarn/vite/github/anything_really

There are some examples of CI with jest and CD with GCP, maybe I do one for aws as well... and I think there should be a roadmap

### > Roadmap
| Status | Goal | 
| :---: | :--- | 
| 🚀 | Monorepo with yarn workspaces |
| 🚀 | Typescript in monorepo level |
| 🚀 | Client with React and Vite |
| 🚀 | Package for linting |
| 🚀 | PR pipeline with Jest tests |
| 🚀 | Deploy pipeline for GCP |
| ❌ | Deploy pipeline for AWS |
| ❌ | Making it a "real" template for projects |
 
## contributing
Feel free to use/clone/copy this repository as you please, and I would love to help/see it too 🤘🏻

## License
I *feel like* it is MIT, but I honestly have no idea

## contact
`@gkm2806` on linkedin if you are fancy, but I probably will answer faster here (forks, issues created) or on Instagram
